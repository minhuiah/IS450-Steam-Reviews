<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<li>Game development is a time-sensitive process, and developers do not have time to read reviews.</li>
<li>In the fog of development, it is often incredibly difficult to be self-aware of the shortcomings of the video game.</li>
<li>This leads to misguided development decisions as game developers are not adequately considering player feedback.</li>
<li>Our project aims to extract important insights from video game reviews efficiently, so that developers are more informed when allocating studio resources to fix/improve their game.</li>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
Topic modelling was first performed to identify the topics talked by the reviewers. Topic modelling was performed using:-
1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
2) BERTopic
3) Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

After getting the topics, sentiment analysis was performed using:-
1) VADER
2) Naives Bayes Classifier
3) Logistic Regression

      "Review: They certainly dumbed down the series since the last release. Sure it raked in a larger audience but it sacrificed what is was previously in the process, which was once well written and unique instead became copy-paste and bland. The game completely omits that Triss did nothing but screw Geralt over with everything she's done involving for the Sorceresses Lodge, most likely just to have her as a romance option. This isn't the only thing it omits either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing says player hand holding like Geralt's *detective vision* removing any player involvement in questing, and Geralt's permanent monologuing to ensure the player knows what they're seeing scene to scene on the rollercoaster. Most quests will follow the same formula of: Talk to person > get told to go somewhere > while at somewhere, learn the person you talked to first is morally dubious > but so is the new person you meet in the quest > get money from either person and move on to next quest.\n",

      "Gwent was a good minigame, and the minigame shouldn't be more enjoyable than the actual game. Unfortunately, Gwent was also poorly balanced. Fixed by the spin off expansion of Gwent that you can play instead with more balance, but more child friendly too, because swearing is bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all it's a shame, they had some fantastic ideas in the game that were ruined by trying to dumb everything else down as much as possible. It's also a great and interesting world. The gameplay is dull and generic. Quite the \"meh\" experience, for what could have been so much more.\n",

      "Review: I don't recommend this game unless you have played the Witcher 1 and 2. Sure, this is a great game, but many things don't make sense without context. Who's Foltest? Why should you care about Dandelion? etc. It is a heavily story-based series. The combat and a lot of mini-quests are not actually that great. The quests range from good to incredible, but you will simply miss too much if you skip the first two games. The payoff that you get from being a lowly amnesiac in the first game to a living legend by the end of this one makes it all worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as for the game itself, a great theme of the Witcher series is choice, and the Witcher 3 has them in abundance. Be careful not to save scum or spoil your way out of every bad situation. For one, some choices don't have immediate effects, and these effects are not always black and white; for the other, there is a great lesson to be had in each bad decision. The game makes you realize not just what you did wrong, but how you did wrong, in an almost philosophical way, which is quite a rare thing. I would say there are many instances of dilemmas such as the \"trolley problem\", where it is not clear whether your interference is a net \"good\". Of course, when you do make a decision you are happy with, you certainly feel better about yourself, but there is value in neutrality, which is also another overarching theme the Witcher tries to teach you.\n",
